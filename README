This is a personal money management system. And I hope it can be more than a money/transaction/purchasing record website.
The basic objective is allow you to record and track your accounting online. The basic principle
is SIMPLICITY and CONSISTENT.  SIMPLICTY implies that the whole website, regardless its profuse
features or not, the core parts(accounts and money recording) should be really simple and
obvious for users, and in addition, the 'professional' features should not be
'professional'--the learning cost should be low enough for the naive users. This will be our
first distinguishing point in contrast to other similar softwares/websites, e.g. GNUCash. The
second principle is CONSISTENT, it has two meanings: 1. The users experience of the website
should be CONSISTENT with(or at least 'feels like') with their old customs when they used pens
and accounting record books to get everything done. 2. The user experience within the website
should always be CONSISTENT. These two characteristics ensure the SIMPLICITY of the whole website.
For the further effort, I hope it has such additional promising features showed below:
 1. Transaction Searching:
  - Search base on the range of dates; [easy]
  - Search base on the keywords of the titles of all the transactions; [middle]
  - Search base on several keywords(merchants, markets etc.). [Hard]
  - Full text search. [insane]
 2. Report Generating:
  - Generate Reports about a user specified period's bank accounts/transaction activities in
    text. [easy]
  - Similar to the above one, but in GRAPH. [Hard]

 3. Comment and Rate each item/service has been purchased [Hard]
 4. Recommend which to buy or not to buy due the rates and comments items.[Hard]
 5. 'Cookbook': -- A very interesting part, it allows users to document their own cooking style.
  - User can write down the materials required by a particular dish by typing or copying from
    the website. Automatically process these data. [easy]

    material. [middle]
